These are all mostly short and sweet functions which intend to calculate, validate, or perform some logic on user input. These functions helped me learn 
the logic and intent behind programming when I initially started out; I thought it was worthy enough to post on GitHub so that many can see my 
progression as I gradually learned programming over the years.
